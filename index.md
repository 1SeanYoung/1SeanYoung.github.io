### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 2 taught me how to use functions, and have the values received
    from std::cin imputed into the function. This was one of the first times
    that I was able to put what I learned in use, and that made it memorable.
    I also found it fun to use the std::cout and std::cin.

* Lab 6
    Lab 6, part 2 taught us how to code blackjack. We coded on another file and
    included it in the main, which was pretty cool. It was also satisfying
    because that was the first card game that I had coded, and it was fun to
    code based on the rules of the game.

* Lab 7
    Lab 7, part 2 taught us to code parkings. We coded when a car would be allowed to park on a specific street. It was fun because I was able to code based on street signs, and that was interesting.
